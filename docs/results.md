* Our Objectives 
* Represent data from Spotify's public playlists as a graph in which: 
* Songs are represented as vertices * Songs are connected by edges if they share a playlist * The number of shared playlists determines the edge weight
* Given a song as an input, use the following techniques to locate related songs:
Iterative deepening depth-first search * Dijkstra's algorithm * Depth-first search
