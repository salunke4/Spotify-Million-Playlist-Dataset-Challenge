# Development

### Week 0 (11/1)
This week we as a group worked on deciding what we wanted to do for our final project. All of us wanted to work on a unique dataset so we decided to utilize the Spotify Million Playlist Dataset (MPD). Our code would take two songs as input from the user and then generate a list of recommended similar songs from the MPD. We also got together as a group and completed our team contract. A group chat as well as a loose work timeline were created to organize a method of communication and a general idea of how we would go about completing this project. Rohan was the project leader and Prathamesh was the note-taker for this week.

### Week 1 (11/8)
This week we focused on making sure our data was reliable and then retrieving the data set and cleaning it. Once we had retrieved the dataset we realized that the data was quite large and contained data we did not need. Since we as a group were more skilled with data cleaning in Python, we decided to use a Python script to splice the data and get rid of the fields from the dataset that we did not need. This week, Sathvik was the project leader and Guneet was the note-taker. 

### Week 2 (11/15)
This week we completed the data processing process that we had started from the previous week. As a team we decided that we would be using Iterative Deepening DFS as well as Djikstra's algorithm as the algorithms used to complete our project's goals. We also would use DFS to traverse the data. After deciding on these algorithms, we began the implementation of our code and used an edge list when putting our data in a graph. In that graph, the songs were the nodes and the weight of the edges would be the number of times two songs appeared in a playlist together. Guneet was the project leader for this week and Rohan was the note taker. 

### Week 3 (11/22)
This week our group focused mainly on implementing the algorithms that we chose last week and writing basic test cases to check if our graph class worked properly. We especially wanted to make sure that each of the nodes were properly connected and if each of the edges had the correct weight. Since we also completed our DFS traversal code, we wrote test cases to see if our DFS algorithm was properly traversing the data. Prathamesh was the project leader and Guneet was the note-taker for this week. 

### Week 4 (11/29)
This week our group focused on completing the code we still had yet to complete from last week. We still had yet to implement our Iterative Deepening Depth First Search as well as Djikstra's algorithm so we completed those this week. We also wrote test cases to test if those algorithms were working the way they are supposed to. Since we finished writing all our code, we began overall testing of our code. There were some slight errors so we began debugging those this week as well. Sathvik was the project leader and Guneet was the note taker for this week. 

### Week 5 (12/6)
We completed the testing process and created an executable file using our Makefile. We completed the iterative deepening DFS algorithm and created all of the required test cases to ensure that it is traversing correctly. Djikstra's algorithm was also completed, and test cases for the algorithm were created. To ensure that the application builds the playlist correctly, we tested it using a variety of songs from our database. Rohan is the project leader this week, and Sathvik is the note-taker.
