# Development

### Week 0 (11/1)
In this week we as a group worked on deciding what we wanted to do for our final project. All of us wanted to work on a unique dataset so we decided to utilize the Spotify Million Hits. Our code would take a song in as input from the user and then generate 5 recommended similar songs from the Spotify Million Hits dataset. We also got together as a group and completed our team contract. A group chat as well as a loose work timeline were created to organize a method of communication and a general idea of how we would go about completing this project. Rohan was the project leader and Prathamesh was the note-taker for this week.
### Week 1 (11/8)
In this week we focused on making sure our data was reliable then retrieving the data set and cleaning it. Once we had retrieved the Spotify Million Hits playlist we realized that the data was quite large and contained data we did not need. Since we as a group were more skilled in Python, we decided to use Jupyter Notebook to splice the data and get rid of the columns from the dataset we did not need. This week Sathvik was the project leader and Guneet was the note-taker.
