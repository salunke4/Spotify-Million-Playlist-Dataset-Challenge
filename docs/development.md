# Development

### Week 0 (11/1)
In this week we as a group worked on deciding what we wanted to do for our final project. All of us wanted to work on a unique dataset so we decided to utilize the Spotify Million Hits. Our code would take a song in as input from the user and then generate 5 recommended similar songs from the Spotify Million Hits dataset. We also got together as a group and completed our team contract. A group chat as well as a loose work timeline were created to organize a method of communication and a general idea of how we would go about completing this project.
