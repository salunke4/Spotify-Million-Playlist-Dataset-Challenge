# CS 225 Final Team Project
#### sperka2-rohanhh2-guneets2-salunke4

## Communication
### 1) Team Meetings: 
Our team will meet once a week in person at one of our apartments on Sundays at 3pm. Each meeting should last around an hour or so, depending on the work that we need to accomplish for that week. We will rotate who takes notes at each meeting, and these notes will be shared with the rest of the team following each meeting. If we are unable to meet in person on any given week, we will plan to meet on Zoom. 

### 2) Assistance: 
Our team has created a team group chat over text message. We should expect to reply within 24 hours to any questions or issues. 

### 3) Respect: 
We will ensure that each team member feels respected and their voices feel heard by making a point to listen to each other's viewpoints and opinions during all meetings. We will prefer that any decisions made be unanimous, but if that is not possible, we will make decisions by simple majority. Since we are working in a group of 4, a majority will be 3 out of the 4 team members. 

## Collaboration
### 1) Work Distribution: 
Every week, once we identify what work needs to be completed, we will divide up the work according to each member's individual strengths and interests. On a week-to-week basis, we will make sure that the overall work assigned is relatively equal between all group members. If one team member has a conflict, we will work with the rest of the team to divide up the work accordingly between the remaining 3 members. 

### 2) Time Commitment: 
To ensure an equal distribution of work, each team member will be expected to dedicate between 2 and 6 hours of individual work to the project each week. If a given deliverable ends up taking more time than expected, the work should be divided up amongst the team accordingly so that no single member has to bear the majority of the workload. It is the entire team's responsibility to ensure that each week's work is completed on time. However, if a team member is not completing their work, we will have a discussion with them to determine how to best work around the circumstances. 

### 3) Conflict Resolution: 
In the case of any team conflict, we will first try to work the issue out amongst ourselves by meeting with the team and determining how to best work around the issue. However, if this strategy fails, we will discuss with our final project mentor and the course staff to determine the best course of action.
